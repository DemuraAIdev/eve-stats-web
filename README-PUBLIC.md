## API Limitations

- This application uses **public ESI endpoints only** - no authentication required
- Only publicly available character data is shown
- ESI has rate limits - the app includes respectful delays between requests
- Corporation data shows current affiliation based on the character's public profile

## Troubleshooting

**Character data not loading?**

- Verify your character ID is correct in the `.env` file
- Ensure your internet connection can reach `esi.evetech.net`
- Restart the development server after changing the `.env` file

**Corporation shows old data?**

- Try refreshing after a few minutes if you recently changed corps
