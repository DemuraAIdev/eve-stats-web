# EVE Online Public Stats Viewer

A simple Vue.js application that displays **public character information** from EVE Online using the ESI (EVE Swagger Interface) API. This app shows only publicly available data and doesn't require any authentication.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Character Information**: Name, security status, birthday, age
- **Corporation Details**: Current corp name, ticker, member count, tax rate
- **Alliance Information**: Alliance name, ticker, founding date (if applicable)
- **Public Data Only**: No authentication required - shows only public ESI data
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh button to get latest data from ESI
- **Modern UI**: Clean, dark theme with responsive design

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Character ID

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or copy from `.env.example`)
2. Set your character ID in the environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_CHARACTER_ID=your_character_id_here
   ```
3. Save the file and restart the development server

#### How to Find Your Character ID:

**Method 1: zKillboard**

1. Go to [zkillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com)
2. Search for your character name
3. The character ID will be in the URL: `https://zkillboard.com/character/{CHARACTER_ID}/`

**Method 2: ESI API**

1. Use the ESI endpoint: `https://esi.evetech.net/latest/search/?categories=character&search=YourCharacterName&strict=true`
2. The character ID will be in the response

**Method 3: EVE University Tools**

1. Use online EVE tools that can resolve character names to IDs

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5174` (or another port if 5174 is busy).

## Usage

1. **Initial Setup**: Set your character ID in the `.env` file as `VITE_CHARACTER_ID`
2. **Refresh Data**: Click the "Refresh" button to fetch the latest data from ESI
3. **Browse Skills**: Use the search and sort features to explore your skills
4. **Monitor Stats**: Keep track of your ISK, SP, and character progression

## API Limitations

- This application uses **public ESI endpoints only** - no authentication required
- Some data (like wallet balance and skills) may require the character to have **public API access**
- ESI has rate limits - the app includes respectful delays between requests
- **Wallet data** requires your character's wallet to be public in EVE Online settings

## Making Data Public in EVE Online

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This application only uses public ESI endpoints. To see your private data (wallet, skills, attributes), you need to make them public in EVE Online:

### Steps to Make Data Public:

1. **Log into EVE Online**
2. **Open Character Sheet** (Alt+A)
3. **Go to "Public Information" tab**
4. **Check the boxes for:**
   - ‚úÖ **Wallet Balance** - to see your ISK
   - ‚úÖ **Skills** - to see your skill list and SP
   - ‚úÖ **Character Sheet** - to see your attributes

### What You'll See:

- **‚úÖ Always Available**: Character name, corporation, security status, birthday
- **üîí Requires Public Setting**: Wallet balance, skill details, attributes

### Privacy Note:

Making data public means other players can also see this information via ESI and sites like zKillboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API requests
- **ESI API** for EVE Online data

```

## Customization

You can easily customize the dashboard by:

1. **Adding new ESI endpoints** in `useEsiApi.ts`
2. **Creating new dashboard cards** in `StatsView.vue`
3. **Modifying the color scheme** using Tailwind CSS classes
4. **Adding more character data** like assets, orders, or mail

## Troubleshooting

**Character data not loading?**

- Verify your character ID is correct
- Check that your character has public API access enabled
- Ensure your internet connection can reach `esi.evetech.net`

**Wallet showing 0 ISK?**

- Make sure your wallet balance is set to public in EVE Online
- Check ESI API status at [EVE Status](https://status.eveonline.com/)

**Skills not displaying names?**

- The app automatically fetches skill names from ESI
- If names show as "Skill {ID}", there may be API rate limiting
